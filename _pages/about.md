I'm a 4th year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science working with [Prof. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/mining/qi-yu) at [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab, RIT](https://www.rit.edu/mining/). I completed my undergraduate in Computer Engineering from [Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus](https://pcampus.edu.np/), Nepal.

### Research Interests

My research interests include uncertainty quantification, openset detection and calibration in machine learning models.
I am working with ML models ranging from vision to Large Language Models.
